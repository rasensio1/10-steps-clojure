A Clojure library designed to... teach beginners how to get started with Clojure! 

## No Fat

I want to get you up and running in a fun environment as quickly as possible.

I find that the biggest hurdle in learning something new is getting stuck before you can have any fun!

#Get Excited!

Why learn Clojure?

  * It's a LISP! Be the diamond in the rough of programmers.

#Web Resources

If you don't care about running clojure locally (yet), there is a REPL (place to type in code and have it evaluated) [here.](http://www.tryclj.com/)

An awesome list of exercises is found at [4Clojure.](http://www.4clojure.com/problems)

That should be enough to get you started.

I also found that doing [ Project Euler problems ](https://projecteuler.net/archives) was very beneficial to getting comfortable in Clojure.
