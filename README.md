# steps-clojure

A Clojure library designed to... teach beginners how to get started with Clojure! 

## No Fat

I want to get you up and running in a fun environment as quickly as possible.

I find that the biggest hurdle in learning something new is getting stuck before you can have any fun!

#Hosted Resources

If you don't care about running clojure locally, there is a REPL (Place to type in code and have it evaluated) [here.](http://www.tryclj.com/)


#Local Resource

You need one thing to strat playing with clojure on the web

You need three things to start playing with clojure on your local environment.
